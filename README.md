# Calculator

Calculator built with a general UI. Users can either click on buttons or type using their keyboards to input numbers, decimal and operators. These inputs will be displayed on the calculator screen which can then be computed. This calculator follows the same rules as a typically calculator where you need at least two operands and an operator in between those operands to perform a calculation. The functions supported are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, backspace, equals and clear all. Chaining operations is also supported in this calculator.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JS

### What I learned

I reinforced my ability to manipulate the DOM and tying it together with the different logics required for the calculator. I used DOM manipulation to select the calculator buttons and implemented the corresponding functions. I learned how to take user inputs and display it while they are clicking and/or typing inputs. I also learned how to use the forEach function to apply click events to buttons that are related (for example the number buttons). Another thing I learned was how to keep track of different states such as if the decimal button was already pressed or not.
